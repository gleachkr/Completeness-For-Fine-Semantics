# Completeness for Fine Semantics

This repository contains a formally verified proof that a semantics in the
style of Fine's 1974 [Models For Entailment](https://www-jstor-org.er.lib.k-state.edu/stable/30226092) is sound
and complete for the minimal relevant Logic B. The general structure of the
proof (and some of the digressions) follows the presentation found in Shay
Logan's forthcoming Cambridge Element, Relevance Logic.
